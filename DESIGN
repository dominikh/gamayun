- meant for private trackers. no DHT etc
- made for long-term seeding of tens of thousands of torrents
  - avoid O(torrents) operations. e.g a client UI shouldn't require iterating over all torrents on each update to get its state or statistics
- made for remote UIs
- no support for ultra-low memory systems. we won't be wasteful with memory, but we'll use more memory if it significantly improves performance
- probably no support for racing. we'll not violate protocols to race, e.g. by ignoring the announce interval
- probably no support for ancient clients. we'll depend on protocol extensions when they're ubiquitous
